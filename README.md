# BacterialMorpholgiesFlow_Models
Code for the transport-dependent colonization and mechanics-dependent colonization models used in "Bacterial species with different nanocolony morphologies have distinct flow-dependent colonization behaviors" by Hallinen, K.M., Bodine, S.P., Stone, H.A., Muir, T.W, Wingreen, N.S., and Gitai, Z., PNAS (2024)

#Transport Model
In the transport model folder, you will find 3 matlab files. ODE_EF_ModelFigure3 will run the ODE transport model and create the graph from figure 3 in the paper, with a positive beta term. ODE_Staph_ModelFigure3 will run the ODE transport model and create the graph from figure 3 in the paper, with a negative beta term. ODE_Staph_IntermediateFlows_forSupplement will run the ODE model at the intermediate flow rates and create the graph for the model prediction shown in figure S4.
